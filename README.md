# Reason Why
We chose this topic because the housing market is turbulent and there is a lot of attention on airbnb and how they are priced.

We are seeking through our linear regression machine learning model to understand how to correlate the price of a listing San Diego to other factors such as neighbourhood, amenities and reviews. Our data will be stored in a SQL database using postgres.

# Team Dynamics 
Our primary communication is in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays and on slack throughout the week.

# Data Source

The data we are using for this project is from insideairbnb.com. We chose this site since it scrapes the data directly from airbnb's website. 


### What should listing price be for new rentals in San Diego?
* Using supervied machine learning classification model to group prices based on location. 
* Which neighborhoods have highest vs lowest prices.
* Listings per neighborhood.
* Good vs bad reviews.
* Seasonality of rentals. Do prices change per season?
* House amenities.
* Merge all four data sets and have a column for season.
* can use muiltple visulizations from both the prediction model and basic analysis(similar to tableau model). check out pair plots. map plots in tableau.
