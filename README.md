# Project Background
Airbnb is a housing platform used by people around the world, be it home-owners, renters, or customers looking for living accomodations. The platform has been in the news a lot recently regarding their pricing and whether or not it is sustainable long-term. Airbnb expects hosts to set their own prices, and there are not many (if any) free services that provide accurate pricing for people looking to rent out their place.

Pricing is important, especially as decline has decreased over the past couple of years due to COVID and other risk factors preventing people from vacationing. People looking to put their property on the site need to be carfeful what price they set. Too low means not maximising earning potential, and too high means people are less likely to book.

Our project aims to identify key variables in Airbnb data and use our machine learning model to predict, as accurately as we can, the daily rent price a property should be listed at in San Diego.

# Team Dynamics 
Our primary communication is in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays and on slack throughout the week.

# Data Source

The dataset used for this project came from insideairbnb.com, a site consisting of a group of collaborators who scrub Airbnb listings, neighborhoods, and reviews from cities all over the world. For the purposes of this project, we are using quarterly data from the last 12 months to provide a complete overview of the city across an entire year. The data we gathered puts the number of Airbnbs currently listed on the platform at about 14,000.

### What should listing price be for new rentals in San Diego?
* Using supervised machine learning classification model to group prices based on location. 
* Which neighborhoods have highest vs lowest prices.
* Listings per neighborhood.
* Good vs bad reviews.
* Seasonality of rentals. Do prices change per season?
* House amenities.
* Merge all four data sets and have a column for season.
* can use muiltple visulizations from both the prediction model and basic analysis(similar to tableau model). check out pair plots. map plots in tableau.
